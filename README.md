# FakeNewsDetection
Its An Machine Learning Model Designed To Detect Fake And True News.
## Introduction
In Today's World,The Scenarios Becomes So Worst In The Realm Of Information Sharing As Everyone Have The Freedom Of Speech The Social Media Platforms Serves Everyone Various Ways To Share Information But Some People Are Misusing It And Spreading information That Doesn't Have Genuine Soures Of Origin And People Aren't Aware Of Information Genuineness They Are Forwarding Those Information To Everyone.This Causes Adverse Effects In Society.
## Solution
We Have To Find The Informtion Genuineness Before It Spreads Wide,For To Do This We Have Use Machine Learning Concepts To Deal With This Issue As Social Media Contains Vast Amounts Of Data Its Not Possible To With Man Force.
## Approach
We have To Create A Machine Learning Classification Model Using The Classification Algorithms Available.

## Technologies Used
We Are Using Python Programing Language As It Serve Both Machine Learning And DataPreprocessing Steps. 
  1.	Data Analysis & Pre-processing
  2.	Model Training &Testing
  3.	Accuracy Measures
  4.	Prediction & Visualization
## Classification Models Used
  1.Logistic Regression
  2.Decision Trees
  3.Random forests
